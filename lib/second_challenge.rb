  epic_tragedy = {
    :montague => {
      patriarch: {},
      matriarch: {},
      hero: {},
      hero_friends: []
      }, 
    :capulet => {
      #your key/value pairs here!
      }}

  
end


Fill out the empty hash that is the value of the `:montague` key. There are four keys in this hash:

* `:patriarch`
* `:matriarch`
* `:hero`
* `:hero_friends`

The first three of these keys point to a value of an empty hash. The fourth key `:hero_friends` has a value of an empty array.

Then, do the same for the empty hash that is the value of the `:capulet` key. This time, your keys are:

* `:patriarch`
* `:matriarch`
* `:heroine`
* `:heroine_friends`
